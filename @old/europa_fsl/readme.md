# The test scripts of FSL in europa

I made two scripts for test run of fsl in europa:

The first one is `fsl_edd_dMRI.sh`, and the required files are stored at `dMRI/dMRI` directory. This one is running `eddy_openmp` to do parallel computing using CPU.

The second one is `fsl_fnirt_struct.sh`, and the required files are stored at `struct` directory. This one is a **NORMAL** fsl command, without any special deployment of `openmp`.

```bash
svn export https://github.com/yilewang/TVB_Demo/trunk/europa_fsl --force
# chmod +x fsl*
cd europa_fsl
./fsl_eddy_dMRI.sh
./fsl_fnirt_struct.sh

```

Please let me know if you have any questions!!!
